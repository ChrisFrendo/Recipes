Homemade Sorbet Recipe

1. First of all put the sugar and water into a pan on the hob.
   Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 3 minutes. 
   Add your quartered pears and, unless they’re super soft, continue to simmer for 5 minutes. 
   Remove from the heat, leave to one side for 5 minutes, then add the lemon juice (minus the pips) and zest. 
   Pour everything into a food processor and whiz to a purée, then push the mixture through a coarse sieve into the dish in which you want to serve it.

2. Add the grappa, give it a good stir, and taste. The grappa shouldn’t be overbearing or too powerful.
   (If you use too much alcohol the sorbet won’t freeze.) 
   Put the dish into the freezer and whisk it up with a fork every half-hour – you’ll see it becoming pale in colour.
   After a couple of hours it will be ready. The texture should be nice and scoopable.

NB: Pears can be replaced with other fruit.
