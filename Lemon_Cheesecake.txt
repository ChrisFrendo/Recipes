Lemon Cheesecake Recipe

1. Preheat oven to 180C or 160C fan. 
2. Grease a 20cm springform cake tin. 
3. Pulse biscuits in a food processor until finely chopped. Transfer to a bowl and add butter. 
4. Stir until combined. 
5. Spoon biscuit mixture into prepared cake tin and press evenly on base and sides. 
6. Cool in the fridge for at least 30 mins.
7. In a medium-sized bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar and lemon zest with an electric mixer until smooth.
8. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, until combined. 
9. Pour mixture into tin and place on a baking tray. Bake for 25-30 mins, or until just set in the centre. Turn off oven and leave cheesecake in the oven with the door ajar for a couple of hours or until oven is completely cool. 
10. Chill in the fridge for 2 hrs.
11. For the lemon curd, combine lemon zest, juice, sugar, butter and eggs in a saucepan over low heat. 
12. Cook, stirring, for 5-10 mins, or until mixture thickens. 
13. Strain through a fine sieve onto a dinner plate or flat tray (this helps the lemon curd cool more quickly).
14. Pour curd over cheesecake. Chill in the fridge until serving.
15. Serve cheesecake with whipped cream and lemon zest.
