----Baked Apple Pie Taquitos----

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9-by-12-inch casserole dish 
   with coconut oil cooking spray and set aside. 

2. In a medium-size saucepan, combine apples, flour, coconut sugar, 
   lemon, coconut oil, water, cinnamon and nutmeg.

3. Turn heat to medium-high and let mixture cook down until a thick 
   sauce forms (about 5 to 7 minutes), stirring often. The apples should
   still be a bit crunchy at this point.

4. Prep taquitos by placing 1 to 2 tablespoons of the apple pie mixture 
   into the middle of each 4-inch tortilla. Tightly roll up each tortilla 
   to create a taquito and place into the casserole dish. 

5. In a small bowl, mix together coconut sugar and cinnamon.

6. Generously spray tops of taquitos with coconut oil cooking spray or 
   rub with coconut oil. Sprinkle tops of taquitos with cinnamon sugar. 
   Spray again with cooking spray. 

7. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes.

8. Meanwhile, into a high-speed food processor combine dates, water and salt.
   Process on high until a paste forms. Add more water, if needed. 

9. Let taquitos cool and serve with date caramel and ice cream.

----Cinnamon Roll Pancakes----

1. In a small mixing bowl, combine 2 tablespoons butter, brown sugar and 1 1/2
   teaspoons cinnamon. Whisk until well combined. Pour into a squeeze bottle and set aside.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine buttermilk, eggs, maple syrup, remaining 6
   tablespoons butter and vanilla extract. Whisk until well combined. 

3. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine flour, baking soda, baking powder,
   salt and 2 remaining cinnamon. Whisk until well combined. 

4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, mixing just until combined.

5. Grease a griddle and preheat to low. Pour the pancake batter on the griddle 
   to form individual pancakes. Once bubbles appear on the tops of the pancakes, swirl
   cinnamon roll topping over the top of the pancakes, being careful to focus on the 
   center and avoid the sides of the pancakes. Allow the cinnamon roll topping to set
   for about 30 seconds, then flip the pancakes and continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.

6. Garnish with chopped walnuts, if desired, and serve with maple syrup.

----Gingerbread Cupcakes----

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 12 muffin tins or 24 mini muffin tins.

2. Combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg and salt.

3. In a separate bowl, whisk together melted butter, brown sugar, molasses and egg.

4. Add 1/4 cup of the milk to the melted butter mixture plus half of the dry mixture,
   stirring well. Add remaining dry ingredients and milk until combined.

5. Pour batter into muffin tins. Bake for 20 to 22 minutes, or until an inserted 
   toothpick comes out clean. Remove cupcakes from oven and cool on a rack for at least 30 minutes.

6. While the cupcakes are cooking and cooling, beat butter and cream cheese until light and fluffy.

7. Add sugar, cinnamon and vanilla.

8. Add the milk, a tablespoon at a time, until the frosting is just spreadable. Do not add too much milk.
   If the frosting is warm, cover and place in refrigerator for a few minutes before frosting cupcakes.

9. Once the cupcakes are completely cooled, fill a piping bag with frosting and pipe large swirls onto
   the tops of each cupcake. Lightly sprinkle cinnamon on top of frosting for decoration.
