----Burrata bruschetta----
1. Mix the sugar snap peas, peas, broad beans and radish with the chillies and herbs in a bowl. Add the chardonnay vinegar and olive oil, and toss to coat.

2. Heat grill to high. Brush the bread with oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Grill for 2 mins each side until lightly charred. Put each piece of toast on a small plate, then halve burratas and gently spread over the toast. Divide the summer beans, pile on top and season to serve.

----Charred chicory cups and walnut brittle----
1. Start by making the brittle. Brush the oil over a baking tray, then tip the sugar into a frying pan. Put the pan over a medium-high heat to melt the sugar, swirling the pan occasionally to ensure it melts evenly – but don’t stir or it will crystallise. When it starts to look like golden syrup, add the walnuts, caraway seeds and fennel seeds. Stir briefly to coat the walnuts in the molten sugar, then swiftly and very carefully pour it onto the greased tray. Leave to cool for 10 mins, then chop into small pieces.

2. In a bowl, beat together the cheeses with a wooden spoon until smooth. Transfer to a disposable piping bag and keep in a cool place until needed.

3. Remove the outer leaves from the chicory heads. Carefully pick off the remaining leaves until you have 20-25 nice ones (keep the core to make the syrup, for the Chicory Collins cocktails, if you like).

4. Put 6-8 of the chicory leaves, curved-side up, in a large, non-stick frying pan over a high heat. Let them sit for 1-2 mins or until the very edges start to char. Take them out of the pan with tongs and leave to cool on a large platter, curvedside down. Repeat until all the chicory leaves have been toasted.

5. Toast the butternut squash, a small handful at a time, in the same non-stick pan. Cook for 2-3 mins or until the squash feels drier and is just starting to turn dark brown at the very edges. Transfer to a plate and repeat until all the butternut squash has been cooked.

6. To assemble the canapés, snip the end off the piping bag to create a round nozzle, then pipe a small blob of the cheese mixture into each chicory cup. Add a generous pinch of the butternut squash, and top with one or two pieces of pickled walnut. Pipe another blob of the cheese mixture onto each one, and scatter over the pieces of brittle. Finally, scatter over the green chillies and serve.

----Supergreen soup with yogurt & pine nuts----
1. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over a low-medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt, then cook slowly, stirring occasionally, for 10 mins until softened but not coloured. Add the garlic and cook for 1 min more.

2. Tip in the potato followed by the veg stock. Simmer for 10-12 mins until the potato is soft enough that a cutlery knife will slide in easily. Add the bag of salad and let it wilt for 1 min, then blitz the soup in a blender until it’s completely smooth.

3. Serve with a dollop of yogurt, some toasted pine nuts and a drizzle of chilli oil, if you like.

=============================Main Courses============================

----Courgette carpaccio----
1. Cut the ends off the courgettes to make them each about 12cm long. Use a mandolin or swivel blade peeler to shave 4 thin slices from each courgette (use the offcuts and leftovers for another dish). Arrange the courgettes, overlapping, over two plates (alternating the colour if you’ve used yellow and green) and trim the edges on the plate to make perfect rectangles. Season with flaky sea salt and half the lemon juice. Set aside.

2. Stack the mint leaves together, roll tightly, then finely shred. Scatter the mint, pine nuts and rocket over the courgettes, then drizzle everything generously with olive oil and more lemon juice. Scatter over the cheese, finish with the lemon zest and serve.

----Mumsy's vegetable soup----
1. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the bread on a baking tray with the caraway seeds, half the oil and some sea salt, and bake for 10-15 mins or until golden and crisp. Set aside.

2. Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the garlic, carrot and potato and cook for 5 mins, stirring frequently, until a little softened.
Add the stock, tomatoes, sugar, bouquet garni, celery and seasoning and bring to a rolling boil. Reduce the heat, simmer for 10 mins, then add the cauliflower and cabbage. Cook for 15 mins until the veg is tender.

3. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce and mushroom ketchup. Remove the bouquet garni and serve the soup in bowls with the caraway croutons.

----Asparagus & new potato frittata----
1. Heat the grill to high. Put the potatoes in a pan of cold salted water and bring to the boil. Once boiling, cook for 4-5 mins until nearly tender, then add the asparagus for a final 1 min. Drain.

2. Meanwhile, heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan and add the onion. Cook for about 8 mins until softened.

3. Mix the eggs with half the cheese in a jug and season well. Pour over the onion in the pan, then scatter over the asparagus and potatoes. Top with the remaining cheese and put under the grill for 5 mins or until golden and cooked through. Cut into wedges and serve from the pan with salad.


===============================Desserts==============================

----Baked Apple Pie Taquitos----

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9-by-12-inch casserole dish 
   with coconut oil cooking spray and set aside. 

2. In a medium-size saucepan, combine apples, flour, coconut sugar, 
   lemon, coconut oil, water, cinnamon and nutmeg.

3. Turn heat to medium-high and let mixture cook down until a thick 
   sauce forms (about 5 to 7 minutes), stirring often. The apples should
   still be a bit crunchy at this point.

4. Prep taquitos by placing 1 to 2 tablespoons of the apple pie mixture 
   into the middle of each 4-inch tortilla. Tightly roll up each tortilla 
   to create a taquito and place into the casserole dish. 

5. In a small bowl, mix together coconut sugar and cinnamon.

6. Generously spray tops of taquitos with coconut oil cooking spray or 
   rub with coconut oil. Sprinkle tops of taquitos with cinnamon sugar. 
   Spray again with cooking spray. 

7. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes.

8. Meanwhile, into a high-speed food processor combine dates, water and salt.
   Process on high until a paste forms. Add more water, if needed. 

9. Let taquitos cool and serve with date caramel and ice cream.

----Cinnamon Roll Pancakes----

1. In a small mixing bowl, combine 2 tablespoons butter, brown sugar and 1 1/2
   teaspoons cinnamon. Whisk until well combined. Pour into a squeeze bottle and set aside.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine buttermilk, eggs, maple syrup, remaining 6
   tablespoons butter and vanilla extract. Whisk until well combined. 

3. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine flour, baking soda, baking powder,
   salt and 2 remaining cinnamon. Whisk until well combined. 

4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, mixing just until combined.

5. Grease a griddle and preheat to low. Pour the pancake batter on the griddle 
   to form individual pancakes. Once bubbles appear on the tops of the pancakes, swirl
   cinnamon roll topping over the top of the pancakes, being careful to focus on the 
   center and avoid the sides of the pancakes. Allow the cinnamon roll topping to set
   for about 30 seconds, then flip the pancakes and continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.

6. Garnish with chopped walnuts, if desired, and serve with maple syrup.

----Gingerbread Cupcakes----

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 12 muffin tins or 24 mini muffin tins.

2. Combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg and salt.

3. In a separate bowl, whisk together melted butter, brown sugar, molasses and egg.

4. Add 1/4 cup of the milk to the melted butter mixture plus half of the dry mixture,
   stirring well. Add remaining dry ingredients and milk until combined.

5. Pour batter into muffin tins. Bake for 20 to 22 minutes, or until an inserted 
   toothpick comes out clean. Remove cupcakes from oven and cool on a rack for at least 30 minutes.

6. While the cupcakes are cooking and cooling, beat butter and cream cheese until light and fluffy.

7. Add sugar, cinnamon and vanilla.

8. Add the milk, a tablespoon at a time, until the frosting is just spreadable. Do not add too much milk.
   If the frosting is warm, cover and place in refrigerator for a few minutes before frosting cupcakes.

9. Once the cupcakes are completely cooled, fill a piping bag with frosting and pipe large swirls onto
   the tops of each cupcake. Lightly sprinkle cinnamon on top of frosting for decoration.
