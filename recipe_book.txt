----Banoffee Pie Recipe

1. Line the base of a deep 20cm/8in spring form tin with baking paper.
2. To make the base, crush the biscuits to fine crumbs and melt the 
butter over a low heat. Pour into a bowl and mix to combine. Spoon 
into the base of the tin and press down with the back of a spoon until
 level. Place in the fridge for 15 minutes.
3. To make the filling, heat the butter and sugar in a small non-stick 
saucepan and stir over a low heat until combined. Add the condensed milk
 and bring to the boil, stirring for 2–3 minutes – do not over-boil or 
it will become grainy and fudge-like. Add the vanilla and pour into the 
tin. Place in the fridge for at least 1 hour. 
4. Whip the cream in a bowl until soft peaks form. 
5. Arrange the banana slices in neat rounds on top of the toffee. Spoon 
or pipe the cream on top and level. Set in the fridge for an hour.
6. Remove from the tin, and zig zag the melted chocolate over the top 
or dust with cocoa powder.

----Lemon Cheesecake Recipe

1. Preheat oven to 180C or 160C fan. 
2. Grease a 20cm springform cake tin. 
3. Pulse biscuits in a food processor until finely chopped. Transfer to a bowl and add butter. 
4. Stir until combined. 
5. Spoon biscuit mixture into prepared cake tin and press evenly on base and sides. 
6. Cool in the fridge for at least 30 mins.
7. In a medium-sized bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar and lemon zest with an electric mixer until smooth.
8. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, until combined. 
9. Pour mixture into tin and place on a baking tray. Bake for 25-30 mins, or until just set in the centre. Turn off oven and leave cheesecake in the oven with the door ajar for a couple of hours or until oven is completely cool. 
10. Chill in the fridge for 2 hrs.
11. For the lemon curd, combine lemon zest, juice, sugar, butter and eggs in a saucepan over low heat. 
12. Cook, stirring, for 5-10 mins, or until mixture thickens. 
13. Strain through a fine sieve onto a dinner plate or flat tray (this helps the lemon curd cool more quickly).
14. Pour curd over cheesecake. Chill in the fridge until serving.
15. Serve cheesecake with whipped cream and lemon zest.
