----Homemade Sorbet Recipe----

1. First of all put the sugar and water into a pan on the hob.
   Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 3 minutes. 
   Add your quartered pears and, unless they're super soft, continue to simmer for 
   5 minutes. Remove from the heat, leave to one side for 5 minutes, then add the lemon 
   juice (minus the pips) and zest. Pour everything into a food processor and whiz to a puree, 
   then push the mixture through a coarse sieve into the dish in which you want to serve it.

2. Add the grappa, give it a good stir, and taste. The grappa shouldnÃ­t be overbearing 
   or too powerful. (If you use too much alcohol the sorbet won't freeze.) Put the dish into the 
   freezer and whisk it up with a fork every half-hour and you'll see it becoming pale in colour.
   After a couple of hours it will be ready. The texture should be nice and scoopable.

NB: Pears can be replaced with other fruit.

----Chocolate Cake recipe

1. Preheat your oven to 180âˆ«C/350F/gas 4. Grease 2 x 9Ã® sandwich tins and line
   the bases.

2. In a bowl, mix together the flour, 75g of the cocoa, the baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and 
   1 teaspoon of fine salt and whisk it all together. Keep to one side.

3. Cut 125g of the butter into chunks and place into the bowl of a free standing mixer with a paddle 
   attachment (alternatively, you can use an electric hand whisk and a large mixing bowl). Beat for 
   a couple of minutes until creamy.

4. Add the sugar and beat for a few more minutes until pale. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then 
   add a tablespoon of the vanilla; scraping the mixture off the sides and bottom.

5. Add the dry ingredients to the mixing bowl, along with the freshly brewed coffee and milk, and 
   mix slowly until it all comes together.

6. Beat vigorously for a further minute, then divide the batter between the two cake tins. Place 
   them in the middle of the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until cooked through.
   When they are ready, leave the cakes to cool in their tins for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire 
   rack to cool completely.

7. Cut the remaining butter into chunks and place into the bowl of your free standing mixer with a
   paddle attachment (again, you can use an electric hand whisk and a large mixing bowl instead). 
   Beat on a high speed for 2 minutes until creamy, then sift in the remaining 50g of cocoa and 
   half the icing sugar. Add 2 tablespoons of the milk and beat again for 1 minute.

8. Sift in the remaining icing sugar, and add the remaining milk and Î© a tablespoon of vanilla 
   extract, then beat everything on a high speed for a couple of minutes until super smooth.

9. Use a little buttercream to stick one of the sponges onto your chosen cake stand or board. 
   Spoon on a third of the buttercream and spread it out to the edges of the cake, then top with the 
   second sponge.

10. Spoon on most of the remaining buttercream (reserving a few spoonfuls for piping on top) 
    and gently spread it over the top of the cake and down the sides, until the entire cake is covered.
    Alternatively, you can use a little less buttercream and keep the edges open.

11. Decorate with the fresh berries and shavings of quality chocolate over the top.

                               Pizza-pasta book

================================Introduction=======================================
This recipe book contains 9 pizza-pasta recipes - 3 starters, 3 main courses and
3 desserts. 

===============================Starters==============================

----Focaccia----

1. Place the flour, salt, yeast, olive oil and 300ml of the 
   water into a large bowl. Gently stir with your hand or a wooden spoon
   to form a dough then knead the dough in the bowl for five minutes, 
   gradually adding the remaining water.

2. Stretch the dough by hand in the bowl, tuck the sides into the centre,  
   turn the bowl 80 degrees and repeat the process for about five minutes.

3. Tip the dough onto an oiled work surface and continue kneading for five
   more minutes. Return the dough to the bowl, cover and leave to rise 
   until doubled in size.

4. Line two large baking sheets with baking paper. Tip the dough out
   of the bowl and divide into two portions. Flatten each portion onto a 
   baking sheet, pushing to the corners, then leave to prove for one hour.

5. Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Drizzle the loaves with oil, 
   sprinkle with fine sea salt then bake in the oven for 20 minutes. 
   When cooked, drizzle with a little more olive oil and serve hot or warm.

----Penne Carbonara----

1. Cook the pasta in a large saucepan of salted boiling water until al dente. 
Drain. Return the pasta to saucepan.

2. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium-low heat. Cook, turning, half 
the pancetta for 5 minutes or until golden and crisp. Use tongs to transfer the 
pancetta to a plate lined with paper towel to drain, leaving the fat in the pan.
 Repeat with remaining pancetta. Coarsely chop.

3. Add the pasta to the pancetta fat in the pan. Stir over low heat for 1 minute 
or until coated. Remove from heat. Cool for 1 minute. Stir in the pancetta, 
parmesan, parsley and oil until combined. Quickly stir in the egg until the pasta 
is coated. Season with pepper.

----Tortellini----

1. Blend the flour and eggs together in a food processor until the mixture resembles 
breadcrumbs. Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured work surface and squash the 
crumbs into a ball of dough. Knead the dough for 4-5 minutes, or until smooth and 
elastic. Wrap the dough in cling film and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.

2. For the pesto, grind the basil, pine nuts, parmesan and garlic to a rough paste
in a pestle and mortar. Gradually pour in both the oils, stirring as you add them. 
Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside, covered, 
until needed.

3. To prepare the pasta, dust the rollers of a pasta machine with flour. Cut the 
chilled pasta into three pieces and flatten each out to a thickness of about 1cm/½in.

4. Set the pasta machine to its widest setting and feed one piece of dough through 
the machine, turning the handle with one hand and collecting the rolled dough as it 
comes through the machine with the other.

5. Change the setting on the pasta machine to the next thickest setting, dust the 
rollers with a little flour, then feed the same pasta sheet through the machine again, 
as before. Repeat this process three or four more times, flouring the machine and 
changing the setting down each time, until you reach the penultimate setting. As your 
pasta sheet becomes longer, cut it in half so that the rolling process is more manageable.

6. Repeat the rolling process with the remaining two pieces of dough. Once all of the 
dough has been rolled out, you should have six long sheets of pasta.

7. To make the tortellini, place one long sheet of the pasta onto the work surface with 
the longest side facing you. Place two large basil leaves in the bottom half of the pasta, 
then fold the top half over the basil leaves. Set the pasta machine to its finest setting 
and pass the sheet through the machine again. Repeat the process with the remaining pasta 
sheets and large basil leaves.

8. Cut the pasta sheets into 9cm/4in discs using a cookie cutter. Place one small basil 
leaf into the centre of each, and top with one teaspoonful of ricotta.

9. One by one, brush the edges of each pasta disc with a little water. Bring the edges of 
each disc together to form a semi-circular shape, pressing the edges together with your 
fingertips to seal. Bring the pointed ends of the tortellini towards each other around your 
fingertip to form a ring, then press the corners together using your other hand.

10. Repeat the process with the remaining pasta discs, basil and ricotta; you should end up 
with 20 tortellini.

11. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Carefully lower the tortellini into the 
boiling water, in batches, and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface of 
the water. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside in a bowl, keeping warm. 
Cook the remaining tortellini.

12. Add the pesto to the tortellini and mix gently until coated. Sprinkle over the pine nuts.

13. To serve, spoon the tortellini and pesto onto serving plates. Sprinkle some grated 
parmesan over each and garnish with a few small basil leaves.

=============================Main Courses============================

----Pizza BBQ Chicken----

1. Prepare the pizza dough through step 11, including preheating the 
oven to 475F as described in step 8.

2. Toss 2 Tablespoons of BBQ sauce with the cooked, chopped chicken 
to coat it. Set aside.

3. After waiting 15 minutes as described in step 11, top the crust with 
the BBQ sauce. Add more or less BBQ sauce depending on your taste. Then 
layer on the shredded mozzarella, then the BBQ-coated chicken, shredded 
gouda, then the onion slices. Bake for 14-16 minutes. For the last minute, 
I move the oven rack to the top rack to really brown the edges. That's optional.

4. Top hot pizza with fresh cilantro. Slice pizza and serve immediately. 
Store leftover pizza covered tightly in the refrigerator and reheat as 
you prefer. Baked pizza slices may be frozen up to 1 month. Please see 
homemade pizza crust recipe for how to freeze the pizza dough.

----Penne al Salmone----

1. Put 4 lt of water to boil with 30 gr of coarse sea salt. When the water 
is already boiling, add the pasta. Stir it and start to make the sauce; that 
will take 10 minutes to be ready.

fresh cream, the parsley (preserve a little bit for garnishing), the sundried 
tomato pate or passata and a bit of freshly ground black pepper.

4. Cover and  cook over a gentle heat for 3-4 minutes. The sauce will thicken 
and then will be ready to receive the pasta.

5. Check the pasta; it should be almost ready. Drain it well and add it to the
sauce. Toss all together for 1 min and serve it on a plate. Finish the dish 
with a drizzle of Extra virgin olive oil  and the remaining parsley.

bacon, rosemary, garlic and onion and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened, 
stirring occasionally.

4. Add the minced beef, breaking it apart with the back of a spoon, then 
cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until starting to brown, then pour in the wine. 
Leave to bubble and cook away.

5. Meanwhile, drain and tip the sun-dried tomatoes into a food processor, 
blitz to a paste, then add to the pan with the tomatoes. Stir well, break 
the plum tomatoes apart a little.

6. Cover with a lid then place in the oven for 1 hour, removing the lid and 
giving it a stir after 30 minutes – if it looks a little dry at this stage, 
add a splash of water to help it along.

7. About 10 minutes before the time is up, cook the spaghetti in boiling 
salted water according to the packet instructions.

8. Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water, 
then return to the pan with a few spoons of Bolognese, a good grating of 
Parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.

9. Toss to coat the spaghetti, loosening with a splash of cooking water, 
if needed.

10. Divide the spaghetti between plates or bowls, add a good spoonful of 
Bolognese to each, then serve with a fine grating of Parmesan.

==================================Introduction===================================
This recipe book contains 9 vegetarian recipes - 3 starters, 3 main courses and
3 desserts.


====================================Starters=====================================

----Burrata bruschetta----
1. Mix the sugar snap peas, peas, broad beans and radish with the chillies and
   herbs in a bowl. Add the chardonnay vinegar and olive oil, and toss to coat.

2. Heat grill to high. Brush the bread with oil and sprinkle with sea salt. 
   Grill for 2 mins each side until lightly charred. Put each piece of toast on a 
   small plate, then halve burratas and gently spread over the toast. Divide the
   summer beans, pile on top and season to serve.

----Charred chicory cups and walnut brittle----
1. Start by making the brittle. Brush the oil over a baking tray, then tip the
   sugar into a frying pan. Put the pan over a medium-high heat to melt the sugar, 
   swirling the pan occasionally to ensure it melts evenly â€“ but donâ€™t stir or 
   it will crystallise. When it starts to look like golden syrup, add the walnuts, 
   caraway seeds and fennel seeds. Stir briefly to coat the walnuts in the molten sugar, 
   then swiftly and very carefully pour it onto the greased tray. Leave to cool 
   for 10 mins, then chop into small pieces.

2. In a bowl, beat together the cheeses with a wooden spoon until smooth. 
   Transfer to a disposable piping bag and keep in a cool place until needed.

3. Remove the outer leaves from the chicory heads. Carefully pick off the remaining
   leaves until you have 20-25 nice ones (keep the core to make the syrup, for the 
   Chicory Collins cocktails, if you like).

4. Put 6-8 of the chicory leaves, curved-side up, in a large, non-stick frying pan
   over a high heat. Let them sit for 1-2 mins or until the very edges start to char.
   Take them out of the pan with tongs and leave to cool on a large platter, curvedside down.
   Repeat until all the chicory leaves have been toasted.

5. Toast the butternut squash, a small handful at a time, in the same non-stick pan.
   Cook for 2-3 mins or until the squash feels drier and is just starting to turn dark 
   brown at the very edges. Transfer to a plate and repeat until all the butternut squash 
   has been cooked.

6. To assemble the canapÃ©s, snip the end off the piping bag to create a round nozzle,
   then pipe a small blob of the cheese mixture into each chicory cup. Add a generous pinch 
   of the butternut squash, and top with one or two pieces of pickled walnut. 
   Pipe another blob of the cheese mixture onto each one, and scatter over the pieces of brittle.
   Finally, scatter over the green chillies and serve.

----Supergreen soup with yogurt & pine nuts----
1. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over a low-medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt,
   then cook slowly, stirring occasionally, for 10 mins until softened but not coloured.
   Add the garlic and cook for 1 min more.

2. Tip in the potato followed by the veg stock. Simmer for 10-12 mins until the potato is soft
   enough that a cutlery knife will slide in easily. Add the bag of salad and let it wilt for 1 min,
   then blitz the soup in a blender until itâ€™s completely smooth.

3. Serve with a dollop of yogurt, some toasted pine nuts and a drizzle of chilli oil, if you like.

=============================Main Courses============================

----Courgette carpaccio----
1. Cut the ends off the courgettes to make them each about 12cm long. Use a mandolin or swivel
   blade peeler to shave 4 thin slices from each courgette (use the offcuts and leftovers for another dish).
   Arrange the courgettes, overlapping, over two plates (alternating the colour if you've used yellow and green)
   and trim the edges on the plate to make perfect rectangles. Season with flaky sea salt and half the lemon juice. Set aside.

2. Stack the mint leaves together, roll tightly, then finely shred. Scatter the mint, pine nuts 
   and rocket over the courgettes, then drizzle everything generously with olive oil and more lemon juice.
   Scatter over the cheese, finish with the lemon zest and serve.

----Mumsy's vegetable soup----
1. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the bread on a baking tray with the 
   caraway seeds, half the oil and some sea salt, and bake for 10-15 mins or until 
   golden and crisp. Set aside.

2. Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. 
   Add the garlic, carrot and potato and cook for 5 mins, stirring frequently, until a little softened. 
   Add the stock, tomatoes, sugar, bouquet garni, celery and seasoning and bring to a rolling boil.
   Reduce the heat, simmer for 10 mins, then add the cauliflower and cabbage. Cook for 15 mins 
   until the veg is tender.

3. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce and mushroom ketchup. Remove the bouquet garni
   and serve the soup in bowls with the caraway croutons.

----Asparagus & new potato frittata----
1. Heat the grill to high. Put the potatoes in a pan of cold salted water and
   bring to the boil. Once boiling, cook for 4-5 mins until nearly tender, 
   then add the asparagus for a final 1 min. Drain.

2. Meanwhile, heat the oil in an ovenproof frying pan and add the onion. 
   Cook for about 8 mins until softened.

3. Mix the eggs with half the cheese in a jug and season well. Pour over the 
   onion in the pan, then scatter over the asparagus and potatoes. Top with the 
   remaining cheese and put under the grill for 5 mins or until golden and cooked 
   through. Cut into wedges and serve from the pan with salad.

----Baked Apple Pie Taquitos----

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9-by-12-inch casserole dish 
   with coconut oil cooking spray and set aside. 

2. In a medium-size saucepan, combine apples, flour, coconut sugar, 
   lemon, coconut oil, water, cinnamon and nutmeg.

3. Turn heat to medium-high and let mixture cook down until a thick 
   sauce forms (about 5 to 7 minutes), stirring often. The apples should
   still be a bit crunchy at this point.

4. Prep taquitos by placing 1 to 2 tablespoons of the apple pie mixture 
   into the middle of each 4-inch tortilla. Tightly roll up each tortilla 
   to create a taquito and place into the casserole dish. 

5. In a small bowl, mix together coconut sugar and cinnamon.

6. Generously spray tops of taquitos with coconut oil cooking spray or 
   rub with coconut oil. Sprinkle tops of taquitos with cinnamon sugar. 
   Spray again with cooking spray. 

7. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes.

8. Meanwhile, into a high-speed food processor combine dates, water and salt.
   Process on high until a paste forms. Add more water, if needed. 

9. Let taquitos cool and serve with date caramel and ice cream.

----Cinnamon Roll Pancakes----

1. In a small mixing bowl, combine 2 tablespoons butter, brown sugar and 1 1/2
   teaspoons cinnamon. Whisk until well combined. Pour into a squeeze bottle and set aside.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine buttermilk, eggs, maple syrup, remaining 6
   tablespoons butter and vanilla extract. Whisk until well combined. 

3. In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine flour, baking soda, baking powder,
   salt and 2 remaining cinnamon. Whisk until well combined. 

4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, mixing just until combined.

5. Grease a griddle and preheat to low. Pour the pancake batter on the griddle 
   to form individual pancakes. Once bubbles appear on the tops of the pancakes, swirl
   cinnamon roll topping over the top of the pancakes, being careful to focus on the 
   center and avoid the sides of the pancakes. Allow the cinnamon roll topping to set
   for about 30 seconds, then flip the pancakes and continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.

6. Garnish with chopped walnuts, if desired, and serve with maple syrup.

----Gingerbread Cupcakes----

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 12 muffin tins or 24 mini muffin tins.

2. Combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg and salt.

3. In a separate bowl, whisk together melted butter, brown sugar, molasses and egg.

4. Add 1/4 cup of the milk to the melted butter mixture plus half of the dry mixture,
   stirring well. Add remaining dry ingredients and milk until combined.

5. Pour batter into muffin tins. Bake for 20 to 22 minutes, or until an inserted 
   toothpick comes out clean. Remove cupcakes from oven and cool on a rack for at least 30 minutes.

6. While the cupcakes are cooking and cooling, beat butter and cream cheese until light and fluffy.

7. Add sugar, cinnamon and vanilla.

8. Add the milk, a tablespoon at a time, until the frosting is just spreadable. Do not add too much milk.
   If the frosting is warm, cover and place in refrigerator for a few minutes before frosting cupcakes.

9. Once the cupcakes are completely cooled, fill a piping bag with frosting and pipe large swirls onto
   the tops of each cupcake. Lightly sprinkle cinnamon on top of frosting for decoration.
