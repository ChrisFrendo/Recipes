===============================Starters==============================
--Focaccia

1. Place the flour, salt, yeast, olive oil and 300ml of the 
   water into a large bowl. Gently stir with your hand or a wooden spoon
   to form a dough then knead the dough in the bowl for five minutes, 
   gradually adding the remaining water.

2. Stretch the dough by hand in the bowl, tuck the sides into the centre,  
   turn the bowl 80 degrees and repeat the process for about five minutes.

3. Tip the dough onto an oiled work surface and continue kneading for five
   more minutes. Return the dough to the bowl, cover and leave to rise 
   until doubled in size.

4. Line two large baking sheets with baking paper. Tip the dough out
   of the bowl and divide into two portions. Flatten each portion onto a 
   baking sheet, pushing to the corners, then leave to prove for one hour.

5. Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Drizzle the loaves with oil, 
   sprinkle with fine sea salt then bake in the oven for 20 minutes. 
   When cooked, drizzle with a little more olive oil and serve hot or warm.

--Penne Carbonara

1. Cook the pasta in a large saucepan of salted boiling water until al dente. 
Drain. Return the pasta to saucepan.

2. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium-low heat. Cook, turning, half 
the pancetta for 5 minutes or until golden and crisp. Use tongs to transfer the 
pancetta to a plate lined with paper towel to drain, leaving the fat in the pan.
 Repeat with remaining pancetta. Coarsely chop.

3. Add the pasta to the pancetta fat in the pan. Stir over low heat for 1 minute 
or until coated. Remove from heat. Cool for 1 minute. Stir in the pancetta, 
parmesan, parsley and oil until combined. Quickly stir in the egg until the pasta 
is coated. Season with pepper.

--Tortellini

1. Blend the flour and eggs together in a food processor until the mixture resembles 
breadcrumbs. Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured work surface and squash the 
crumbs into a ball of dough. Knead the dough for 4-5 minutes, or until smooth and 
elastic. Wrap the dough in cling film and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.

2. For the pesto, grind the basil, pine nuts, parmesan and garlic to a rough paste
in a pestle and mortar. Gradually pour in both the oils, stirring as you add them. 
Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside, covered, 
until needed.

3. To prepare the pasta, dust the rollers of a pasta machine with flour. Cut the 
chilled pasta into three pieces and flatten each out to a thickness of about 1cm/½in.

4. Set the pasta machine to its widest setting and feed one piece of dough through 
the machine, turning the handle with one hand and collecting the rolled dough as it 
comes through the machine with the other.

5. Change the setting on the pasta machine to the next thickest setting, dust the 
rollers with a little flour, then feed the same pasta sheet through the machine again, 
as before. Repeat this process three or four more times, flouring the machine and 
changing the setting down each time, until you reach the penultimate setting. As your 
pasta sheet becomes longer, cut it in half so that the rolling process is more manageable.

6. Repeat the rolling process with the remaining two pieces of dough. Once all of the 
dough has been rolled out, you should have six long sheets of pasta.

7. To make the tortellini, place one long sheet of the pasta onto the work surface with 
the longest side facing you. Place two large basil leaves in the bottom half of the pasta, 
then fold the top half over the basil leaves. Set the pasta machine to its finest setting 
and pass the sheet through the machine again. Repeat the process with the remaining pasta 
sheets and large basil leaves.

8. Cut the pasta sheets into 9cm/4in discs using a cookie cutter. Place one small basil 
leaf into the centre of each, and top with one teaspoonful of ricotta.

9. One by one, brush the edges of each pasta disc with a little water. Bring the edges of 
each disc together to form a semi-circular shape, pressing the edges together with your 
fingertips to seal. Bring the pointed ends of the tortellini towards each other around your 
fingertip to form a ring, then press the corners together using your other hand.

10. Repeat the process with the remaining pasta discs, basil and ricotta; you should end up 
with 20 tortellini.

11. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Carefully lower the tortellini into the 
boiling water, in batches, and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface of 
the water. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside in a bowl, keeping warm. 
Cook the remaining tortellini.

12. Add the pesto to the tortellini and mix gently until coated. Sprinkle over the pine nuts.

13. To serve, spoon the tortellini and pesto onto serving plates. Sprinkle some grated 
parmesan over each and garnish with a few small basil leaves.
