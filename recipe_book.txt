===============================Starters==============================
--Focaccia

1. Place the flour, salt, yeast, olive oil and 300ml of the 
   water into a large bowl. Gently stir with your hand or a wooden spoon
   to form a dough then knead the dough in the bowl for five minutes, 
   gradually adding the remaining water.

2. Stretch the dough by hand in the bowl, tuck the sides into the centre,  
   turn the bowl 80 degrees and repeat the process for about five minutes.

3. Tip the dough onto an oiled work surface and continue kneading for five
   more minutes. Return the dough to the bowl, cover and leave to rise 
   until doubled in size.

4. Line two large baking sheets with baking paper. Tip the dough out
   of the bowl and divide into two portions. Flatten each portion onto a 
   baking sheet, pushing to the corners, then leave to prove for one hour.

5. Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Drizzle the loaves with oil, 
   sprinkle with fine sea salt then bake in the oven for 20 minutes. 
   When cooked, drizzle with a little more olive oil and serve hot or warm.

--Penne Carbonara

1. Cook the pasta in a large saucepan of salted boiling water until al dente. 
Drain. Return the pasta to saucepan.

2. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium-low heat. Cook, turning, half 
the pancetta for 5 minutes or until golden and crisp. Use tongs to transfer the 
pancetta to a plate lined with paper towel to drain, leaving the fat in the pan.
 Repeat with remaining pancetta. Coarsely chop.

3. Add the pasta to the pancetta fat in the pan. Stir over low heat for 1 minute 
or until coated. Remove from heat. Cool for 1 minute. Stir in the pancetta, 
parmesan, parsley and oil until combined. Quickly stir in the egg until the pasta 
is coated. Season with pepper.

--Tortellini

1. Blend the flour and eggs together in a food processor until the mixture resembles 
breadcrumbs. Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured work surface and squash the 
crumbs into a ball of dough. Knead the dough for 4-5 minutes, or until smooth and 
elastic. Wrap the dough in cling film and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.

2. For the pesto, grind the basil, pine nuts, parmesan and garlic to a rough paste
in a pestle and mortar. Gradually pour in both the oils, stirring as you add them. 
Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside, covered, 
until needed.

3. To prepare the pasta, dust the rollers of a pasta machine with flour. Cut the 
chilled pasta into three pieces and flatten each out to a thickness of about 1cm/½in.

4. Set the pasta machine to its widest setting and feed one piece of dough through 
the machine, turning the handle with one hand and collecting the rolled dough as it 
comes through the machine with the other.

5. Change the setting on the pasta machine to the next thickest setting, dust the 
rollers with a little flour, then feed the same pasta sheet through the machine again, 
as before. Repeat this process three or four more times, flouring the machine and 
changing the setting down each time, until you reach the penultimate setting. As your 
pasta sheet becomes longer, cut it in half so that the rolling process is more manageable.

6. Repeat the rolling process with the remaining two pieces of dough. Once all of the 
dough has been rolled out, you should have six long sheets of pasta.

7. To make the tortellini, place one long sheet of the pasta onto the work surface with 
the longest side facing you. Place two large basil leaves in the bottom half of the pasta, 
then fold the top half over the basil leaves. Set the pasta machine to its finest setting 
and pass the sheet through the machine again. Repeat the process with the remaining pasta 
sheets and large basil leaves.

8. Cut the pasta sheets into 9cm/4in discs using a cookie cutter. Place one small basil 
leaf into the centre of each, and top with one teaspoonful of ricotta.

9. One by one, brush the edges of each pasta disc with a little water. Bring the edges of 
each disc together to form a semi-circular shape, pressing the edges together with your 
fingertips to seal. Bring the pointed ends of the tortellini towards each other around your 
fingertip to form a ring, then press the corners together using your other hand.

10. Repeat the process with the remaining pasta discs, basil and ricotta; you should end up 
with 20 tortellini.

11. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Carefully lower the tortellini into the 
boiling water, in batches, and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface of 
the water. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside in a bowl, keeping warm. 
Cook the remaining tortellini.

12. Add the pesto to the tortellini and mix gently until coated. Sprinkle over the pine nuts.

13. To serve, spoon the tortellini and pesto onto serving plates. Sprinkle some grated 
parmesan over each and garnish with a few small basil leaves.

=============================Main Courses============================
--Pizza BBQ Chicken

1. Prepare the pizza dough through step 11, including preheating the 
oven to 475F as described in step 8.

2. Toss 2 Tablespoons of BBQ sauce with the cooked, chopped chicken 
to coat it. Set aside.

3. After waiting 15 minutes as described in step 11, top the crust with 
the BBQ sauce. Add more or less BBQ sauce depending on your taste. Then 
layer on the shredded mozzarella, then the BBQ-coated chicken, shredded 
gouda, then the onion slices. Bake for 14-16 minutes. For the last minute, 
I move the oven rack to the top rack to really brown the edges. That's optional.

4. Top hot pizza with fresh cilantro. Slice pizza and serve immediately. 
Store leftover pizza covered tightly in the refrigerator and reheat as 
you prefer. Baked pizza slices may be frozen up to 1 month. Please see 
homemade pizza crust recipe for how to freeze the pizza dough.

--Penne al Salmone

1. Put 4 lt of water to boil with 30 gr of coarse sea salt. When the water 
is already boiling, add the pasta. Stir it and start to make the sauce; that 
will take 10 minutes to be ready.

2. In a frying pan, put the EVOO, warm it for about 30 seconds. Crush the 2 
garlic cloves and add them to the oil until golden (roughly 2 min) and then 
discard them.

3. Add  the smoked salmon to the oil. Stir it for a minute or two then add the 
fresh cream, the parsley (preserve a little bit for garnishing), the sundried 
tomato pate or passata and a bit of freshly ground black pepper.

4. Cover and  cook over a gentle heat for 3-4 minutes. The sauce will thicken 
and then will be ready to receive the pasta.

5. Check the pasta; it should be almost ready. Drain it well and add it to the
sauce. Toss all together for 1 min and serve it on a plate. Finish the dish 
with a drizzle of Extra virgin olive oil  and the remaining parsley.


--Spaghetti Bolognese

1. Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.

2. Peel and finely chop the garlic and onions, pick and finely chop 
the rosemary, then finely slice the bacon.

3. Heat a splash of oil in a casserole pan on a medium heat, add the 
bacon, rosemary, garlic and onion and cook for 5 minutes, or until softened, 
stirring occasionally.

4. Add the minced beef, breaking it apart with the back of a spoon, then 
cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until starting to brown, then pour in the wine. 
Leave to bubble and cook away.

5. Meanwhile, drain and tip the sun-dried tomatoes into a food processor, 
blitz to a paste, then add to the pan with the tomatoes. Stir well, break 
the plum tomatoes apart a little.

6. Cover with a lid then place in the oven for 1 hour, removing the lid and 
giving it a stir after 30 minutes – if it looks a little dry at this stage, 
add a splash of water to help it along.

7. About 10 minutes before the time is up, cook the spaghetti in boiling 
salted water according to the packet instructions.

8. Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water, 
then return to the pan with a few spoons of Bolognese, a good grating of 
Parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.

9. Toss to coat the spaghetti, loosening with a splash of cooking water, 
if needed.

10. Divide the spaghetti between plates or bowls, add a good spoonful of 
Bolognese to each, then serve with a fine grating of Parmesan.
