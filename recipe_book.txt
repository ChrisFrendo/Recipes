Banoffee Pie Recipe

1. Line the base of a deep 20cm/8in spring form tin with baking paper.
2. To make the base, crush the biscuits to fine crumbs and melt the 
butter over a low heat. Pour into a bowl and mix to combine. Spoon 
into the base of the tin and press down with the back of a spoon until
 level. Place in the fridge for 15 minutes.
3. To make the filling, heat the butter and sugar in a small non-stick 
saucepan and stir over a low heat until combined. Add the condensed milk
 and bring to the boil, stirring for 2–3 minutes – do not over-boil or 
it will become grainy and fudge-like. Add the vanilla and pour into the 
tin. Place in the fridge for at least 1 hour. 
4. Whip the cream in a bowl until soft peaks form. 
5. Arrange the banana slices in neat rounds on top of the toffee. Spoon 
or pipe the cream on top and level. Set in the fridge for an hour.
6. Remove from the tin, and zig zag the melted chocolate over the top 
or dust with cocoa powder.
