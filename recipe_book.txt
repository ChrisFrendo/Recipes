----Fettuccine Al Fredo Recipe---- 

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
   Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. 

2. In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat.
   Add salt, pepper and garlic salt. 
   Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted; this will thicken the sauce. 

3. Add pasta to sauce. Use enough of the pasta so that all of the sauce is used
   and the pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.

----Beef Fillet Recipe----

1. Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7 (fan 200C).

2. Rub the fillet of beef with plenty of salt and pepper and the oil.

3. Heat a large frying pan until very hot. Fry the fillet on all sides
   until browned. Transfer to a roasting tin.

4. Place the fillet in the centre of the roasting tin, arrange the whole
   garlic bulbs around the fillet and drizzle with a little oil. 
   Roast for 23 minutes for medium-rare (only 20 minutes if it is a long, thin piece).

5. When the beef is cooked, remove from the oven, cover with aluminium 
   foil and leave to rest for 15 minutes.

6. Serve hot or you can leave it to cool, and then wrap in more foil 
   and place in the fridge to cool completely.

7. To make the sauce, cut the roasted garlic bulbs in half horizontally 
   and squeeze the garlic paste from each single clove into a bowl. 
   Add the mayonnaise, crème fraîche and sugar.

8. Blend to a smooth purée using a blender or food processor. 
   Stir in the wholegrain mustard. Chill until ready to serve alongside the beef.

9. Carve the beef into thin slices just before serving.

----Pizza Norma Recipe----

1. Preheat oven to 230°C. Rinse eggplant, halve lengthwise, and cut crosswise
   into ¼-inch slices. Tear mozzarella into small pieces.

2. Heat 1½ tablespoons olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. 
   When oil is shimmering, add eggplant in a single layer, working in batches if necessary.
   Season with ½ teaspoon kosher salt and pepper as desired.
   Sauté, flipping halfway through, until crisp on outside, about 8 minutes total.
   Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.

3. While eggplant sautés, sprinkle flour onto a clean dry surface.
   Using a rolling pin or the heels of your hands, roll and stretch pizza 
   dough to about ¼-inch thickness. Rub 1 teaspoon olive oil on a 
   parchment-lined baking sheet, then carefully add pizza dough.

4. Spread marinara sauce over pizza, leaving a 1-inch border. 
   Add eggplant in an even layer. Top with mozzarella, then dot over ricotta salata.

5. Transfer pizza to bottom rack of oven and bake until crust is crisp and 
   light golden and cheese is bubbling, 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse basil
   and tear leaves into bite-size pieces, discarding stems.

6. Cut pizza into slices, garnish with basil, and dig in. Refrigerate any
   leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

----Banoffee Pie Recipe----

1. Line the base of a deep 20cm/8in spring form tin with baking paper.

2. To make the base, crush the biscuits to fine crumbs and melt the 
   butter over a low heat. Pour into a bowl and mix to combine. Spoon 
   into the base of the tin and press down with the back of a spoon until
   level. Place in the fridge for 15 minutes.

3. To make the filling, heat the butter and sugar in a small non-stick 
   saucepan and stir over a low heat until combined. Add the condensed milk
   and bring to the boil, stirring for 2–3 minutes – do not over-boil or 
   it will become grainy and fudge-like. Add the vanilla and pour into the 
   tin. Place in the fridge for at least 1 hour. 

4. Whip the cream in a bowl until soft peaks form. 

5. Arrange the banana slices in neat rounds on top of the toffee. Spoon 
   or pipe the cream on top and level. Set in the fridge for an hour.

6. Remove from the tin, and zig zag the melted chocolate over the top 
   or dust with cocoa powder.

----Lemon Cheesecake Recipe----

1. Preheat oven to 180C or 160C fan. 

2. Grease a 20cm springform cake tin. 

3. Pulse biscuits in a food processor until finely chopped. 
   Transfer to a bowl and add butter. 

4. Stir until combined. 

5. Spoon biscuit mixture into prepared cake tin and press evenly on base and sides. 

6. Cool in the fridge for at least 30 mins.

7. In a medium-sized bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar and lemon zest 
   with an electric mixer until smooth.

8. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, until combined. 

9. Pour mixture into tin and place on a baking tray. Bake for 25-30 mins, 
   or until just set in the centre. Turn off oven and leave cheesecake 
   in the oven with the door ajar for a couple of hours or until oven
   is completely cool. 

10. Chill in the fridge for 2 hrs.

11. For the lemon curd, combine lemon zest, juice, sugar, butter and
    eggs in a saucepan over low heat. 

12. Cook, stirring, for 5-10 mins, or until mixture thickens. 

13. Strain through a fine sieve onto a dinner plate or flat tray 
    (this helps the lemon curd cool more quickly).

14. Pour curd over cheesecake. Chill in the fridge until serving.

15. Serve cheesecake with whipped cream and lemon zest.

----Homemade Sorbet Recipe----

1. First of all put the sugar and water into a pan on the hob.
   Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 3 minutes. 
   Add your quartered pears and, unless they're super soft, continue to simmer for 
   5 minutes. Remove from the heat, leave to one side for 5 minutes, then add the lemon 
   juice (minus the pips) and zest. Pour everything into a food processor and whiz to a puree, 
   then push the mixture through a coarse sieve into the dish in which you want to serve it.

2. Add the grappa, give it a good stir, and taste. The grappa shouldnít be overbearing 
   or too powerful. (If you use too much alcohol the sorbet won't freeze.) Put the dish into the 
   freezer and whisk it up with a fork every half-hour and you'll see it becoming pale in colour.
   After a couple of hours it will be ready. The texture should be nice and scoopable.

NB: Pears can be replaced with other fruit.
